#Green Eggs & Ham (& Regular Expressions)

Using the built in method (`save_as filename, contents`) and string (`txt`) provided in `regexp.rb`, write regular expressions to perform the following requests...

1. Count all instances where Sam is not referred to as "Sam-I-Am."  (.scan might be helpful here)
2. Create a file, "list", that lists all the places and animals whom Sam refuses to eat with (the bigot).
3. Create a file, "sammy_jam", in which all instances of Sam-I-Am to "Sammy Jam." (We're talking .gsub baby!)
4. Create a new file, "affirmative", in which the narrator constantly agrees to eat (ie, remove the nots).
5. Create a new file, "matt", where "Sam" is "Matt," and is referred to as "Matt-I-Say", and the narrator is being forced to eat "coconut oil and lamb".
***bonus***
6. List all of the sentences that are repeated twice in a row in a file "repeats". This way you can prove to the narrator that he has a problem and should see a doctor before his dimentia gets worse.
